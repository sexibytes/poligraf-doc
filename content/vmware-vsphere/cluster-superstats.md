In PoliGraf 0.99f, we introduced new cluster level metrics computed from hosts metrics like hba, network, storage, power etcâ€¦ So now you can visualise your 1000 clusters stats in a second. We've also added datastore count, cpu latency and allocated memory.

Basically, the SuperStats dashboard is simply more scalable than the FullStats but we keep the old one for compatibility purposes.

In 0.99g version we've added memory overhead and svmotion count.
